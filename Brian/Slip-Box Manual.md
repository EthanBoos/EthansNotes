Use two slip-boxes: one for references, another as the main one.

Do not copy ideas or quotes in the main slip-box. 

Elaborate every note enough to have the potential to become part of a final written piece.

When adding a new note, check the slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Make transitions from one context to another.

Use only one page per idea ~ roughly 500 words.

Index each note for navigation purposes.
