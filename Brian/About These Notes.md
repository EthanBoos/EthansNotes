Welcome to my thinking space!

Structurally I follow basic [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann#:~:text=person.%5B26%5D-,Note%2Dtaking%20system,-(Zettelkasten)) [[Slip-Box Manual|slip-box techniques]] with the addition of [[Evergreen Note Manual|evergreen notes]] serving as maps of content (indexes). These notes are broken up into two slip-boxes: [[About The Bibliography|Bibliography]] and [[About The Generator|Generator]]. The Generator serves as the main working area. 

I'm sharing these in an attempt to convince family, friends, and frankly anyone who will listen to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to [take smart notes.](https://www.ethanboos.com/blog/book-review-how-to-take-smart-notes-by-sonke-ahrens)
